This is my gardening diary and notebooks. 

 The Goal: To create a place that I can organize information about all the the plants, fruits and flowers that I want to grow. At this point I do not things I need to used a lot of Javascript, but this may change in the future. This project is not only to complete a final project for the Code 201 but also for my own interest as well. I will try to build this webpage even after I finish the course.
