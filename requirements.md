# Requirements

## What is the vision of this product?

This product will be mostly be my notebook and diary when I am growing my backyard garden. As a Vietnamese, some of the vegetables and herbs that we eat are rare to find in the US supermarket. And even if I can find them in Asian supermarket, those are really expensive. 

At this point I do not think I need to use a lot of javascript at this point. But I think I will try to build my database as I go and try to utilize java in the long run. 

## What pain point does this project solve?

This page will include most of the information that needed for each specific plants that I want to grow, as long as the tips to care for them that I collected by experience. As sometime I forget about these and the result was that all my plant died. 

## Why should we care about your product?

It will help gardening more informative and enjoyable. Gardening is like meditation for me. It helps me reduce stress and calm my mind. Moreover, I have fresh veggies and herbs to cook everyday. 

## What will your MVP functionality be?

I should have a least one example for one plant, one fruit/flower and one herb.
